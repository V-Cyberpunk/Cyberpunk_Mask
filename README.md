# Cyberpunk_Mask
In Times of SARS-CoV-2 you will need a fancy mask for your runs in Night City!

## Introduction
I'm V, a Cyberpunk, and I have the only possible solution for a corona mask: a fancy cyberpunk mask!
Inspiration for that project was my best friend: The G.
He inspired to develop and build this.

## Material

- Case for electronics
- 3-wire-cable (I used 4-wire und let one empty)
- batteryholder for 4 AAA batteries
- 4 AAA batteries
- 1N4001 diode to avoid reversed polarity
- switch for switching the mask on and off
- 2 push buttons for right and left blinking effect
- step-down converter module for stable 5V supply
- Arduino Nano with ATmega AVR 328P (China Arduino with CH340 USB-to-Serial module is good, too!)
- some wires
- 3,5mm jack and connector
- heat-shrink tube
- two 10k pull-up resistors
- 510 ohms resistor
- WS2812B LED strip (I used two 7LED strips in serial connection)
- mask (I bought black masks on ebay)
- hook-and-loop-tape (for taking off the led stripes, if you have to wash your mask)
- washable fabric glue for glueing the tape on the mask

## Software

- Arduino IDE
- Adafruit NeoPixel library
